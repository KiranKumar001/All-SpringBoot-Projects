# Y Spring-Boot ?

- Spring framework feature, like dependency Injection/ Inversion of control (Identify bean, identify dependency and wire them)
- Boot features i.e loads lots of configs at boot. Ex: Webservers like tomcat are configed at boot, no need to manually set it up.
- Helps in loose coupling of applications, i.e Microservices
- Has own framework/support to integrate with other applications like kafka (Spring-Kafka), DB (Spring-Data-JPA) etc...
- Integrates with other frameworks like redis, ibm-mq etc...
- Extensive support over the internet.
